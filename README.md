Master thesis R file for replication
My master thesis, entitled as "Social Contagion in Homophilic Value-Based Social Networks: Two-Step Simulations of Network Generation and Optimal Seeding Applied in the Threshold Model", is a simulation study. I show my R file here for replication and reproduction. I do not put any data output here due to its simulation nature.
You can find codes for algorithm, model, plot making.
